    /**
     * Returns a stream consisting of the longest prefix of elements of the
     * passed stream that match the given predicate.  If the passed stream is
     * unordered then the resulting prefix (of unordered elements) is
     * nondeterministic; the prefix will be selected from any one of the
     * possible permutations of the elements of the unordered stream.
     *
     * <p>This is a <a href="package-summary.html#StreamOps">short-circuiting
     * stateful intermediate operation</a>.
     *
     * <p>This operation can accept a non-interfering stateful predicate to
     * support <em>cancellation</em> of the upstream pipeline.  The stateful
     * predicate may test against external state, such as time, or an
     * accumulating summary value of the elements of this stream.  A false
     * match, which triggers short-circuiting, is said to cancel the upstream
     * pipeline.  Cancellation is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition
     * for a) the stream to terminate normally in a finite time; and b) in a
     * time less than that if cancellation was not performed.
     *
     * <p>Cancellation is more appropriate for unordered stream or sequential
     * stream pipelines, and likely inappropriate for ordered and parallel
     * stream pipelines.  As is ordinarily the case, the resulting prefix will
     * be nondeterministic for unordered stream pipelines.  However, in such
     * cases the resulting prefix will also be nondeterministic for ordered and
     * parallel stream pipelines; the prefix will be a sub-prefix of that
     * produced by an equivalent ordered and sequential stream pipeline.
     *
     * <p><b>Implementation Requirements:</b><br>
     * The default implementation obtains the {@link Stream#spliterator() spliterator}
     * of the passed stream, wraps that spliterator so as to support the
     * semantics of this operation on traversal, and returns a new stream
     * associated with the wrapped spliterator.  The returned stream preserves
     * the execution characteristics of the passed stream (namely parallel or
     * sequential execution as per {@link Stream#isParallel() isParallel()})
     * but the wrapped spliterator may choose to not support splitting.
     *
     * <p><b>API Note:</b><br>
     * While {@code takeWhile()} is generally a cheap operation on sequential
     * stream pipelines, it can be quite expensive on ordered parallel
     * pipelines, since the operation is constrained to return not just any
     * valid prefix, but the longest prefix of elements in the encounter order.
     * Using an unordered stream source (such as {@link #generate(Supplier)})
     * or removing the ordering constraint with {@link Stream#unordered() unordered()}
     * may result in significant speedups of {@code takeWhile()} in parallel
     * pipelines, if the semantics of your situation permit.  If consistency
     * with encounter order is required, and you are experiencing poor
     * performance or memory utilization with {@code takeWhile()} in parallel
     * pipelines, switching to sequential execution with
     * {@link Stream#sequential() sequential()} may improve performance.
     *
     * <p>A use-case for stream cancellation is executing a stream pipeline
     * for a certain duration.  The following example will calculate as many
     * probable primes as is possible, in parallel, during 5 seconds:
     * <pre>{@code
     *     long t = System.currentTimeMillis();
     *     List<BigInteger> pps = RefStreams
     *         .generate(() -> BigInteger.probablePrime(1024, ThreadLocalRandom.current()))
     *         .parallel()
     *         .takeWhile(e -> (System.currentTimeMillis() - t) < TimeUnit.SECONDS.toMillis(5))
     *         .collect(toList());
     *
     * }</pre>
